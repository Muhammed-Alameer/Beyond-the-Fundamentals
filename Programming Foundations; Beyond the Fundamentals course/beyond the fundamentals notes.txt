#collection in programming lets me group similar items together using a single name, which is known as a variable.
 Organizing data in this way has a few advantages.
 creating a collection uses your code structure to indicate that multiple pieces of data are related.

# iterates in programming it's repeats the same procedure multiple times until it reaches a specified endpoint. 
Code that iterates is often described as a loop, because the process moves from beginning to end and then starts over again at the beginning,
 possibly hundreds or even thousands of times.
 Every programming language has syntax just for iteration. 

# The basic ingredients are measured and combined for you, saving you some time but you still get to pick the shape of the pan, 
the type of frosting and any filling or decoration you want to use.
 Sometimes it makes sense to use multiple modules together, so they're distributed and used in a group.

# There are three main types of bugs in computer programs.
- A program has a syntax error when it includes code that doesn't match the rules of the language.
- Sometimes your code can comply with all the rules of the language but still not execute successfully. 
For instance, suppose you include a call to a function that isn't ever defined.
 A function call is a valid statement.This type of bug is known as a run-time error
 because it often isn't obvious until the code is actually run.
-  A third type of error happens when you write code that runs but doesn't produce the results you expect. 
For instance, a loop that counts in the wrong direction continues infinitely. 
And as a result the program never completes execution. This is known as a logic error 

# Object-oriented code breaks a program up into smaller parts known as objects. Each of these objects has its own distinct focus.
 Objects communicate with each other to make the program function,
 but the division into smaller units makes the code easier to maintain and easier to reuse.

# Space is an issue when running a computer program as well. A computer uses two main types of storage.
 There's the drive, which stores programs and data even when the computer is shut down, and there's the memory which holds a copy of any code that's running,
 as well as the results of any calculations and other manipulation that my programs do.
